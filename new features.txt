1. User Interface Improvements
a) Visual Enhancements
Dynamic Styling: Add CSS frameworks like TailwindCSS or Bootstrap to create a cleaner, responsive UI.
Better Graph Styling: Use gradient colors, icons, or shapes for nodes to distinguish between clusters, objects, and attributes.

b) Drag-and-Drop Feedback
Better Drop Feedback: Add animations or transitions when nodes/rows are dragged and dropped.
Highlight Drop Targets: Improve highlighting with animations or glowing effects for valid drop targets.

c) Improved Table Design
Add sorting, filtering, and searching functionalities for the table visualization to allow users to navigate large datasets more easily.
Paginate the table if the number of rows exceeds a threshold (e.g., 50 rows).


2. 3NF Analysis



3. Performance Improvements
a) Optimized Rendering
For large datasets (e.g., 600+ rows), implement virtual scrolling in the table to render only visible rows.
For the graph, optimize rendering by:
Using clustering algorithms to group similar nodes.
Implementing lazy loading of graph nodes and edges for large data.



4. New Functionalities
a) Version Control
Allow users to save versions of their changes and restore previous versions of the graph or table.
Maintain a history of all edits with undo/redo functionality.

b) Data Export
Enable export of graph data in multiple formats (CSV, JSON, Neo4j-compatible queries) for further analysis.
Enable VB export

c) Collaborative Editing
Allow multiple users to edit the graph and table simultaneously with real-time updates (using WebSockets or similar).


d) Enhanced Attribute Management
Introduce bulk actions for attributes (e.g., move multiple attributes at once, batch edit labels).
Add support for attribute inheritance to link related attributes across objects.


5. User Experience Enhancements
a) Tutorial or Onboarding
Provide an onboarding tutorial for new users to explain how to use the app, especially drag-and-drop and label editing.
Add tooltips or inline guidance for complex actions (e.g., 3NF analysis).

6. Data Visualization Enhancements
a) Interactive Filters
Add filters to show/hide specific node types (e.g., only display objects and attributes, hide clusters).


7. Integration Suggestions
a) Neo4j Integration
Add a feature to query Neo4j directly within the app for advanced data exploration (e.g., Cypher query editor).
Allow visualization of query results in both table and graph formats.
b) Machine Learning Features
Add AI-based suggestions for:
Organizing nodes into clusters.
Identifying non-compliant nodes for 3NF analysis.
Predicting possible links between nodes.
